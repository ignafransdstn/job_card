# job_card

E-Job Card, a mobile application that allows mechanics to see tasks, availability of spare parts to be used, processing time, and repair work reports on units owned by a company.

This application itself is built using an API developed based on SOAP technology that is converted into a REST API. From the API, data related to the tasks obtained by the repair planning team is displayed so that information can be conveyed quickly, accurately and easily to mechanics in the field.
